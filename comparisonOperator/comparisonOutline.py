This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

y = "orange" == "orange" 
print(y)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

x = 8 == 0 
print(x)


#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

z = 9 > 3 
print(z)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

s = 5 < 3 
print(s)


#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

r = 4 >= 5
print(r)


#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

t = 6 <= 6 
print(t)


#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.

t  8 == 8 
print(t)
